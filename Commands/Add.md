# git add

when changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you will need to use the `git add`.

items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modifield.

Genarally, you can get away with the command `git add` which will add all files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.

you can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2 which will track specifically file1 and file2.

you can specify tracking directories with ` git add DirectoryName`.

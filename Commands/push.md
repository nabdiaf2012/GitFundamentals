# git push

when you have a [remote](./remote.md) set up you will need to begin to move

you can attach a name and branch name to your command to specify where you are pushing

```
git push origin main
```

this command will push the **main** branch to the remote called **origin**

### Upstream tracking

instead of including the name of the remote and the branch you are on every time 

before doing so, you will need to use `-u` 


git push -u origin main


after this command is used, you can just use `git push`

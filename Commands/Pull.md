# git pull

similar to a [git push](./push.md), a git pull will interact with a remote repository.

this means any commits made that are on the remote rep will be pullled down

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:
```
git pull origin main


if there is any upstream connnection established, you can use git pull
